We are working quickly to launch our new fundraising and event management platform. We are excited to bring nonprofits a higher caliber of engineering at a lower cost. Our platform will provide nonprofit event management, which includes auctions, galas, benefit breakfest/dinner management.

The entire platform will have no cost for entry with options for affordable paid features.  We are listening to concerns of the non-profit community and providing solutions that do more than the status quo.

Check us out on our social media pages. [gorillagive.com][gorillagive] If you have questions, you can send us an email: [info@gorillagive.com][email].
