We are excited to make an announcement about our platform. Today we launched the app marketplace. The marketplace will allow us to provide smaller segment apps, but also enable other organizations to provide apps for other fundraisers and non profits. If you have someone building apps for your event we can help you put them into the marketplace. If you don't have a tech guy and there is an app that you need for an event, we can work with you to build it for no extra charge and place it in our app store. You are basically crowdfunding your apps and everybody wins. If you are not sure if we can help just open a chat, send an email or file a ticket through our site. We will gladly assist.

We have also added some other improvements to our site. You can use the chat bubble icon in the bottom right hand corner of our site to start chatting for support. In addition you can send an email to [support@goriillagive.com][supportemail] and it will generate a support ticket for you, or go to [support.gorillagive.com][support].

This is our first step towards offering you amazing solutions and there will be many more. We are working diligently to provide you with the larger auction management software towards the end of next month.

We appreciate the support everyone has show as we start this journey to make non-profit fundraising software more amazing.
