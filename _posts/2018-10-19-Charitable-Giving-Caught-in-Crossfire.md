Last month, the U.S. Treasury quickly passed new rules that will block states with high state taxes attempt to work around the SALT (State and Local Tax) deductions cap. This new rule has a collateral damage impact on states that promote charitable contributions by providing state tax credits, which until recently did not reduce the amount of deductibility on your federal taxes. If you have been receiving state tax credits on your charitable contributions, you may want to speak with your tax professional or review your strategy to make sure you are not surprised when you file your taxes next spring.

## SALT Caps
At the end of 2017, major tax reform was passed. The tax reform had sweeping benefits for most tax filers, but one pain point for some was the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. This cap greatly impacts those who pay high state tax and/or property tax. There are a handful of states that are the most impacted and felt that their citizens were inappropriately sacrificed. These states began to formalize workarounds, which utilized charitable contributions in lieu of state tax because the $10,000 cap is not a limit on charitable contributions.
## Charitable State Tax Credits
Maybe you have benefited from charitable state tax credits in the past and did not quite understand how they worked. The credit benefit of your contributions varies by state, but the federal treatment was always the same. In the past, the federal tax treatment of your charitable contributions was not impacted by whether you received state tax credits. You would always recognize the full deduction if you itemized on your federal taxes.
I will use Colorado’s Child Tax Credit as an example:
Tax Bracket Assumption for both examples below: 

**24% Marginal Rate**

**$5,000 Charitable Contribution**

                          

|              Pre-US Treasury Ruling  |    |    Post- US Treasury Ruling    |          |
| --------------------   | :-------------: | :-------------------: | :---------------: |
| 50% State Tax Credit   | 	$2,500 benefit | 50% State Tax Credit  |	$2,500 benefit |
| 100% Fed Tax Deduction |	$1,200 benefit | 50% Fed Tax Deduction |	$600 benefit   |
| Total tax benefit 	 |  $3,700	       | Total tax benefit     |	$3,100         |
| Net out of pocket      |  $1,300         | Net out of pocket	   | $1,900            |
{:.table}

**The difference between the two examples is $600 or a 46% difference than the pre-US treasury ruling.**

You can see that the impact to your situation will be proportionate to the amount that you contribute, as well as, the percentage of state tax credit you receive. Some states have programs where you actually receive a credit up to 100% of your contributions, which now would completely negate a federal tax deduction. 
## Final Thoughts
Realistically, the new calculation makes the most sense. The biggest issue, however, is that the ruling was rushed through and was not necessarily meant to target “normal” charitable contributions, but to thwart states attempting to find their way around the SALT caps. The SALT caps initial pain has now spread to impact additional tax filers outside of the previous targets of high state tax and property taxpayers. Most of the charitable organizations and CPAs I have spoken with do not feel that these changes will not likely have a huge impact on charitable giving, even if the tax benefits have been reduced. Their thought process is that those who are charitably inclined do so more because of the causes they care about and are less motivated by tax benefits.
